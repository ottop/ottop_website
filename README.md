# ottop.rip

## What is this?

This is the repository containing the source code for my personal website where I give out personal details for the public internet. You can find the website at [https://ottop.rip/](https://ottop.rip/).

## What is it built with?

The website is built with Python and Django. It uses a basic SQLite database as provided by Django for storing the info on the page. This allows me to modify site contents through the admin panel and since I am simply storing the texts and images shown on the page, it doesn't need anything fancier.

## What are the primary design considerations?

The website is designed with a few primary goals:

- Display information in a clear, categorizes manner.
- Look reasonable visaully.
- Be scalable enough to generally work on both, desktop and mobile devices.
